# Step-by-Step explanation of how data is handled and cleaned in vehicle dataset

### Step 1: Reading and Exploring the Data
Read the Dataset: Import the data from a CSV file.
Inspect the Data: Use commands like head() and tail() to look at the first and last few rows of the dataset. This helps in understanding the structure and contents of the data.

### Step 2: Checking for Missing or Null Values
Identify Missing Values: Check for null or empty cells in the dataset using functions that count missing values for each column.
Visualize Missing Values: Plot a bar chart showing the count of missing values for each feature. This helps in understanding the extent of missing data and which columns are most affected.

### Step 3: Dropping Unwanted Columns
Remove Irrelevant Columns: Identify and drop columns that are not useful for the analysis. Examples include URL-related columns, VIN, image URLs, and descriptions.

### Step 4: Handling Missing Values
Numeric Features: For columns with numeric data types, replace missing values with the mean of the non-missing values in those columns.
Categorical Features: For columns with categorical data types, replace missing values with the mode (most frequent value) of the non-missing values.
Special Handling: Specifically handle certain columns like year, manufacturer, and paint_color by replacing missing values with specific logic (e.g., most common value for year, "Unknown" for manufacturer and paint_color).

### Step 5: Outlier Detection and Removal
Box Plot Visualization: Create box plots for numeric features to visualize the presence of outliers.
Remove Outliers: Define and apply a function to remove outliers. Outliers are typically defined as values beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the first and third quartiles. Remove rows with these outlier values.

### Step 6: Correlation Analysis
Label Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numeric format using label encoding. This is necessary for performing correlation analysis.
Correlation Plot: Generate a correlation matrix and plot it to visualize the relationships between different features. This helps in understanding which features are most important and how they relate to each other.
