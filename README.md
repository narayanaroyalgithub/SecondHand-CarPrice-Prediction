# Step-by-Step explanation of how data is handled and cleaned in vehicle dataset

### Step 1: Reading and Exploring the Data
Read the Dataset: Import the data from a CSV file.

Inspect the Data: Use commands like head() and tail() to look at the first and last few rows of the dataset. This helps in understanding the structure and contents of the data.

### Step 2: Checking for Missing or Null Values
Identify Missing Values: Check for null or empty cells in the dataset using functions that count missing values for each column.

Visualize Missing Values: Plot a bar chart showing the count of missing values for each feature. This helps in understanding the extent of missing data and which columns are most affected.

### Step 3: Dropping Unwanted Columns
Remove Irrelevant Columns: Identify and drop columns that are not useful for the analysis. Examples include URL-related columns, VIN, image URLs, and descriptions.

### Step 4: Handling Missing Values
Numeric Features: For columns with numeric data types, replace missing values with the mean of the non-missing values in those columns.

Categorical Features: For columns with categorical data types, replace missing values with the mode (most frequent value) of the non-missing values.

Special Handling: Specifically handle certain columns like year, manufacturer, and paint_color by replacing missing values with specific logic (e.g., most common value for year, "Unknown" for manufacturer and paint_color).

### Step 5: Outlier Detection and Removal
Box Plot Visualization: Create box plots for numeric features to visualize the presence of outliers.

Remove Outliers: Define and apply a function to remove outliers. Outliers are typically defined as values beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the first and third quartiles. Remove rows with these outlier values.

### Step 6: Correlation Analysis
Label Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numeric format using label encoding. This is necessary for performing correlation analysis.

Correlation Plot: Generate a correlation matrix and plot it to visualize the relationships between different features. This helps in understanding which features are most important and how they relate to each other.

### Step 7: Preparing the Data for Machine Learning
Feature Selection: Identify which features (columns) will be used for prediction and which will be the target variable. In this case, price is the target variable.

Splitting the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the models, while the testing set is used to evaluate their performance. Typically, this is done using an 80-20 split.

Normalization/Standardization: Standardize or normalize the numerical features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps in improving the performance of certain algorithms.

### Step 8: Training Machine Learning Models
Import Necessary Libraries: Import machine learning libraries and models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.

Instantiate Models: Create instances of the models.

Train Models: Fit each model to the training data. This involves the model learning the relationship between the features and the target variable.

### Step 9: Evaluating Model Performance
Predict on Test Set: Use the trained models to make predictions on the test set.

Calculate Metrics: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics help in understanding how well the model is predicting the target variable.

Compare Models: Compare the performance of all models based on the evaluation metrics to determine which model performs the best.

## Conclusion: 
Based on the RMSEs obtained:
"Random Forest RMSE: 6838.62463190773"
"XGBoost RMSE: 10.718696449375"
"Decision Tree RMSE: 11215.9920322319"

XGboost model is preferred to use in order to make predictions of the secondhand car price.
